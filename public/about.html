<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently studying
  <a href="https://en.unimib.it/undergraduate/computer-science">
      <strong>Computer Science at the University of Milan Bicocca.</a>
  </strong>
  <br>
  I chose this course because I've always found computers and autonomation
  fascinating.<br>
  I'm a sporty and nerdy guy! I love being active, in fact I do boxing and I
  always try out new sports.
  <br>
  Speaking of new things, I also enjoy learning new things and fun facts.
  <br>
  Podcasts are the news feed for my brain and Chess is what keeps my brain active
  while having some fun. (Although I'm not really good at it. My ELO is around
  700.)<br>
  Although I'm an introvert person, I love talking to people about things I'm
  particularly interested in.
